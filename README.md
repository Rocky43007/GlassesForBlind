# GlassesForBlind
This code works with prototype editions of Glasses which Would help people see. Uses Python 3, OpenCV, and OpenVINO, with the Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick 2, and code created by Adrian at PyImageSearch. Raspbery Pi and NCS2 Stick Required for functionality for Image detection, as well as a Raspberry Pi Camera. Works best with Raspberry Pi 4 and beyond, with a requried 4GB of ram for optimal and fast responses. Thus far, I have reached Developmental Editons of the Code, which can be seen in the Master Branch. Once Prototyping has ended, the Final editons of Code can be seen in the Production Branch, where new updates can be found.

# Hardware Requirements
1. Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 With Myraid X VPU
2. Ultrasonic Sensor
3. Raspberry Pi Camera

# Look at Project to see next steps.
